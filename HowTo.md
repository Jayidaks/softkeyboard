# Introduction #
Here we'll learn how to install, use, and setup AnySoftKeyboard.

**Note: At the end of this article there a list of other sources from the net for 'How to setup AnySoftKeyboard'.**

## Installing and enabling ##
Open Android Market, and look-up "AnySoftKeyboard".

Click "Install". Note that this application requires some permissions: this keyboard can use the phone's vibration functionality and can read and write to your user-dictionary.

  * You can get AnySoftKeyboard from several other sites [too](http://code.google.com/p/softkeyboard/wiki/HowToGetIt)

After Any Soft Keyboard has been downloaded and installed, go to your phone's settings, and select "Language & keyboard" (or "Locale&text" in Android 1.5).

In the new screen, enable "Any Soft Keyboard".

A dialog box will open and will warn you about possible key-logging attacks which can be done by this keyboard application.
Note: This is a generic message, and will be shown when you enable any keyboard application.

You should not worry about approving this keyboard: First, this is an open source application, so anyone can check the code and see if there is something weird here.
Second, since this application do not have permissions for network access, it is useless for it to store you key-strokes, it can not send it to nowhere :)

Press **OK** to approve the keyboard.

In order to actually use this keyboard, you'll need to activate it.
Go to any application with a text field (e.g., Messaging).

Create a new message, and long press the trackball on one of the text field ("To" or "Type to compose"). A dialog will pop-up.

Select "Input method". Another dialog will pop-up with a list of all installed keyboards in your device.

Select "Any Soft Keyboard".

**That's it!**
The keyboard default layouts are English and Hebrew, so if you want to use a different layout, you should enable it. Read below about how to set it up.

## Settings ##
There are two ways to access AnySoftKeyboard's settings:
  * Under Android Settings, select "Language & keyboard" (or "Locale&text" in Android 1.5), and then "Any Soft Keyboard setting":

  * **Of course, you'll first need to install the layouts.** Do this by pressing the "Search for add-ons".

## Physical keyboard ##
The HTC G1, Motorola Droid/Milestone and other devices include a physical keyboard. It is possible to use the physical keyboard to type in your own language.
The physical keyboard layout will be similar to the one currently selected in Any Soft Keyboard on-screen keyboard.
It is possible to switch layouts by pressing ALT+SPACE in the physical keyboard.
