  * None - no row at the top. Probably because you want to use the 'swipe' gesture to switch layouts.
  * Small - two half height sized keys, one for switching language layouts, the other for symbols.
  * Big - Regular sized keys.

### Effects ###
  * Vibrate on key-press: a short vibration on each key you press.
  * Sound on key-press: a type-writer sound effects will be played when you press on a key.

### Grammar ###
  * Auto-capitalization: will set the first letter in a sentence to capital.
  * Show suggestions: using the keyboard's dictionary AnySoftKeyboard will suggest words similar to the currently typed word.
  * Auto- select suggestion: when pressing SPACE, the highlighted suggestion will be inserted into the text box.
  * Quick fixes: various English fixes (like receive vs recieve).

### Special features ###
AnySoftKeyboad has some nice features which (usually) do not exists in other on screen keyboards.
  * Space switches keyboard: in symbols keyboards, pressing SPACE will automatically switch back to the last used alphabet keyboard.
  * Double space to period: at the end of a sentence, tapping space twice will produce "SPACE+PERIOD" instead of two SPACES.
  * Change swipe gesture actions: AnySoftKeyboard supports gestures for various actions, like switching layouts, dismissing the keyboard or shifting the keyboard.

### Keyboards ###
AnySoftKeyboard supports external packages for adding languages keyboards and dictionaries. In this sub-menu you'll be able to select the desired layouts you want to use.
